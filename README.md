I created this chart from Connor Rothschild's course, Better Data Visualizations with Svelte. I learned how to create a scatterplot by parsing through data and creating a circle based on each data point, added responsiveness to work with all screen sizes, and made it accessible for keyboard users. I also styled and animated the chart using a comibination of CSS and Svelte commands.
